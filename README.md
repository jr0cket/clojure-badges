# badges

A simple gamification app where you can earn badges by going on quests.

Unfortunately we havent defined any quests or challenges as yet, but there should be a badge or two, even if they are a little hard-coded.

App was created as part of the London Clojurians dojo at Thoughworks, on the 30th June 2015.

The App was created using the luminus template, using the command

    lein new luminus badges
